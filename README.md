Pub/Sub is a classic pattern in which message senders, called publishers, do not schedule messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Messages are published without the knowledge of what or if there is any subscriber to that knowledge. The broker ensures that messages are delivered to the correct subscribers.

## üíª Using MQTTChat
The chat is used with only one instance of the python `mqttchat.py` file for each user.

* Messages are sent and received by the mqtt chat.py instance, running in two threads, one for pub and one for sub.
* Message forwarding is performed by the broker provided by HiveMQ.
