Pub/Sub is a classic pattern in which message senders, called publishers, do not schedule messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Messages are published without the knowledge of what or if there is any subscriber to that knowledge. The broker ensures that messages are delivered to the correct subscribers.
